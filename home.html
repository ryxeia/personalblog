        <p>Hi, I’m Xy </span>. I’ve always been a collector of the quietest moments—the way the ends of the rainbow touches the wet road, the warm laughers echoing throughout the room, and the pre-nostalgic, imperfect memories that most people blink and miss. This is a space dedicated to the <span class="highlight1"> art of noticing </span>. <br><br>I created this corner of the webpage to act as a living time capsule, a place where my <span class="highlight1"> little journey in this big world</span> is shown. This isn’t a highlight reel of grand achievements, but rather a slow-motion look at the snippets of life that actually make it feel full. Thanks for being here to share in these small pieces of my world.
